h1. GitDo

The goals for this little project is to:

* Learn Ruby :)
* Test out Grit: http://github.com/mojombo/grit/
* Build a command line/repo based todo list
** git do list
** git do show abc123de
** git do new "Title" => open editor to write todo
* Grep the repo to the word TODO and list the files that the user edited

h2. Repo Setup

The script will create a symbolic ref called gitdo. In this repo, we will store our data.

Not sure what form, YAML, XML, CSV, etc..
